/*
Create a file named array-filtering.js.
In that file, define a variable named numbers that references this array:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Like above, define a variable named filtered that references the result of
numbers.filter().
The function that you pass to the .filter() method will look something like this:
function evenNumbers (number) {
 return number % 2 === 0
}
Pay close attention to the syntax used throughout your solution.
Use console.log() to print the filtered array to the terminal.
Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:
javascripting verify array-filtering.js

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
// Arrow function to make it easier
// but this is the same as:
/*
const filtered = numbers.filter(function (number) {
    return number % 2 === 0;
    });
*/
const filtered = numbers.filter((number) => number % 2 === 0);
console.log(filtered);
